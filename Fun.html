      hummingbirds)
    </p>
    <p>
      <ins class="Student">Biodome:</ins> lazy travel 😎. Spending the day there

    <img src="oldPort.avif" alt="Old port montreal" style="height: 400px" />
    <p>Personally I don't like history but if you do this is a must go.</p>
    <p>
      If you don't then come here anyways because there's a lot of fun souvenir
      shops 🛍️. There's also a ferris wheel.
    </p>
    <p>support local economy 🥺.</p>
    <h4>Laronde</h4>
    <p>Random amusement park. It's really fun (not scary at all).</p>
    <p>Go on the goliath it's the best one 🎢.</p>
    <h4>Oratoire St Joseph</h4>
    <p>
      I don't know what's so interesting about it but it's a very old and
      impressive building.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's on mount royal(?) so it's also nice to take a walk there. My school
      is across from it (also old building) so you can come and say hi!
