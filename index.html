<h2>Nice places to fun</h2>
<h4>Espace pour la vie museums</h4> 
<p>Learn about nature and science! There are 5 museums to explore!</p>
<p>Jardin Botanique: Time to touch grass. It is a giant garden with all sorts of living plants 🌱 (there's also hummingbirds)</p>
<p>Biodome: lazy travel 😎. Spending the day there basically feels like you traveled the entire America continent 🌎! You can explore all the different climates and biodiversities there!</p>
<p>Insectarium: see a bunch of creepy crawlies and there is a butterfly room too 🦋! If your lucky the butterflies might land on you (maybe wear perfume)</p>
<p>Planetarium: discover astronomy secrets 🪐 (I never went but I'm going to go there!!)</p>
<p>Biosphere: It's the Epcot thing 🪩. learn about the current evironmental issues and protect our planet!</p>
<h4>Science center</h4> 
<p>Interactive museum for alll ages 🧪.</p>
<p>😃 Literally always so fun (Even if I went there so many times) </p>
<h4>Old Port</h4> 
<p> Personally I don't like history but if you do this is a must go. </p>
<p>If you don't then come here anyways because there's a lot of fun souvenir shops 🛍️.</p>
<p> support local economy 🥺.</p>
<h4>Laronde</h4> 
<p>Random amusement park. It's really fun (not scary at all).</p>
<p>Go on the goliath it's the best one 🎢.</p>
<h4>Wonderlab </h4> 
<p>Diy phone case, clips, candles 🕯️, etc. at an amazingly expensive price 💸</p>
<p> fun tho so recommand.</p>
<p>honorable mention: 1181 Saint-Catherine St W. It's for claw machine addicts 🦀 (no scam)</p>
<p>Be ready to lose all your money folks </p>
