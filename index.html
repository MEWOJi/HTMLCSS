<h2>1. Nice restaurants & cafes</h2>
<h4>Café Chato</h4> 
<img src="cafe-chato.jpg"  alt="Café Chato" style="height: 400px;">
<p>nice cafe with lots of adorable cats. 😻 <i>meow~ </i></p>
<p>The food is also amazing.</p>
<h4>The alley</h4> 
<p>Best bubble tea place 🧋. Do NOT go to presotea.</p>
<p>They also used to have a pompompurin event  (I missed the merch ☹️) </p>
<h4>Tsujiri</h4> 
<p>they make matcha stuff (ramen, ice cream etc.) </p>
<p>Absolutely delicious (especially the mini dango 🍡).</p>
<p> Try Montreal's japanese food 😈.</p>
<h4> Orange Julep</h4> 
<img src="orange.jpg"  alt="Orange Julep aka the big orange" style="height:400px;">
<p>Taste the best poutines in a big orange 🍊 (apparently it's good but the orange juice is not).</p>
<h4>Mcdonalds</h4> 
<p> ‼️ Montreal specialty ‼️ Must try!!!</p>
<p>-> Only take the nuggies tho.</p>
<p>🐔</p>


<h2>2. Fun places to go</h2>
<h4>Espace pour la vie museums</h4> 
<img src="biodome.jpg"  alt="Biodome" style="height:400px;">
<p>Learn about nature and science! There are 5 museums to explore!</p>
<p><ins>Jardin Botanique:</ins> Time to touch grass. It is a giant garden with all sorts of living plants 🌱 (there's also hummingbirds)</p>
<p><ins>Biodome:</ins> lazy travel 😎. Spending the day there basically feels like you traveled the entire America continent 🌎! You can explore all the different climates and biodiversities there!</p>
<p><ins>Insectarium:</ins> see a bunch of creepy crawlies 🪳 and there is a butterfly room too 🦋! If your lucky the butterflies might land on you (maybe wear perfume)</p>
<p><ins>Planetarium:</ins> discover astronomy secrets 🪐 (I never went but I'm going to go there!!)</p>
<p><ins>Biosphere:</ins> It's the Epcot thing 🪩. learn about the current evironmental issues and protect our planet!</p>
<h4>Science center</h4> 
<p>Interactive museum for alll ages 🧪.</p>
<p>😃 Literally always so fun (Even if I went there so many times) </p>
<h4>Old Port</h4> 
<img src="oldPort.avif"  alt="Old port montreal" style="height:400px;">
<p> Personally I don't like history but if you do this is a must go. </p>
<p>If you don't then come here anyways because there's a lot of fun souvenir shops 🛍️. There's also a ferris wheel.</p>
<p> support local economy 🥺.</p>
<h4>Laronde</h4> 
<p>Random amusement park. It's really fun (not scary at all).</p>
<p>Go on the goliath it's the best one 🎢.</p>
<h4>Oratoire St Joseph </h4> 
<p>I don't know what's so interesting about it but it's a very old and impressive building. </p>
<p> It's on mount royal(?) so it's also nice to take a walk there. My school is across from it (also old building) so you can come and say hi!</p>
<img src="stJoseph.jpg"  alt="Oratoire St Joesph" style="height:400px;">
<ins>honorable mention: </ins>
<p>1181 Saint-Catherine St W. It's for claw machine addicts 🦀 (no scam)</p>
<p>Be ready to lose all your money folks </p>
